# ToDoList AI
A small Django REST API project that integrates AI to transform natural language into structured tasks.  
The goal of this project is to practice working with Django REST Framework, user authentication, and AI-powered task parsing.

## Features
- User registration and login
- Create tasks automatically from natural language input using AI
- CRUD operations on tasks (create, read, update, delete)
- Each user can only access their own tasks
- API documentation with Swagger (drf-spectacular)

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Django & Django REST Framework
- drf-spectacular (Swagger/OpenAPI docs)
- SQLite (default, easy to switch to PostgreSQL)
- OpenAI, gpt-4o
